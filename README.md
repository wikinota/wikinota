# wikinota
wikinota is a selfhosted platform for you ideas and thoughts.
The main focus is set to archiving and inspire new knowledge, through the structuring of thought paths.

Written in pure TypeScript without any dependencies.

This structure is inspired by the [Zettelkasten*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) model.

The second focus is to provide a way to search through this structure of pages, to find relevant informations.

The third focus is a collection of handy tools for evryday life.
