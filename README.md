# wikinota
wikinota is a selfhosted platform for you ideas and thoughts.
The main focus is set to archiving and inspire new knowledge, through the structuring of thought paths.

For this purpose, a new structure of the page hierarchy will be implemented soon.
This structure will be inspired by the [Zettelkasten*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) model.

The second focus is to provide a way to search through this structure of pages, to find relevant informations.

The third focus is a collection of handy tools for evryday life. Like the "Geldlog" (moneylog)
